# Backstory
## Cult Details
- Ceremony focus point is the here at this abandoned rail station https://www.rochestersubway.com/topics/2012/03/from-eyesore-to-opportunity-rochesters-lehigh-valley-rr-station/

## How does magic work?
This is going to be in the style of Laundry Files, I'm not sure if it's set in the world or not yet. Technology = sepllcasting

## BBSes
I'm planning on using the actual list of Bullitin Boards from the Rochester Area circa 1994. This is the printout that I actually had at home on our fmaily computer desk.
This will bethe stand in for now: http://bbslist.textfiles.com/716/


# Message Boards
## Logistics
The players are going to interact with the story via message board posts, what do those look like? Other ideas
- Organize the story un sections, each section has 4-8 posts that will be randomly distributed. This means that you get story bits from the current section before you move on the to the next section but they may not be in order
- Hard code the messsage posts to specific BBSes with breadcrumbs to which BBS to connect to next
- Do we want to have users that appear on multiple boards? We need to make a list of users
- Cult recruiting ads?

## Messages
We need to start writing the messages
BW - 6.14.25
I've used chat gpt to write out placeholders to make sure we've got the structure right before I go in and rewrite and zero-in on the flavor/texture we want. Take a glance and let me know if I'm on track here. The idea is that we have a distribution of messages as follows (completely changeable)

Narrative Beat	% of Total Posts	Posts Per 10
Surface Chatter	50%	~5 per board
Fringe Hints	20%	~2 per board
Cult Drops	15%	~1-2 per board
Disappearances	5%	~0-1 per board
Ritual Details	5%	~0-1 per board
ARG Distractions	5%	~0-1 per board
